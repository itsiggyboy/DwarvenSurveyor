# Dwarven-Surveyor
 Creates a Dwarf Fortress map from exported xml files.
How do I visualize my Dwarf Fortress world using Dwarven Surveyor?

1) Install DF Hack
2) Go to the world you want to visualize, and play it on Legends Mode.
3) Press the "Export XML" button on the top left corner of the screen. This will generate an legends,xml file with the name of that world, and you can find it in the game's installation directory.
4) Click on the DFHack button on the top left of the game, and open the DFHack gui
5) Search for the command "exportlegends", click on it and press enter. This should generate the legendsplus xml file.
6) With both files generated, either take note of their full directory, or move them to a directory that's easier to remember.
7) Open Dwarven Surveyor, and type the directories for both the regular and the plus xml files on their respective fields.
8) Directories should be complete, including the drive and the extension of the .xml file, like so:
    a.C:\MyFolder\legends.xm
    If the directory is valid, the Generate button will be enabled and you can click it to generate your map.
